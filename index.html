            Want to consider switching degrees? 
            Already completed a degree and want to pick up a second one? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Kevin Bacon uses the <a href="https://github.com/aybabtme/groscanot">groscanot</a> API to identify degrees with at least one overlapping course with the degree selected. Degrees are sorted by the number of extra courses needed to get the degree. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Courses that would fall into the 'extra' data field are not shown so there maybe additional courses you needed.
